		This project is aimed at creating a machine learning model which can predict cardiovascular disease using various parameters including history of Covid-19. Standard tools will be used which are easily available to all, and with some modifications, they can accurately predict cardiovascular disease. The objective is to predict early onset heart disease in patients during a treatment procedure which can allow medical professionals to save more lives using the power of machine learning. I propose a system that integrates various machine learning algorithms for the purpose of achieving better heart disease prediction accuracy and issuing better diagnostics.
